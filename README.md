# Wildfire-Severity-ML-US
This project develops regionally adaptive machine learning models to predict wildfire severity across the United States using climate, spatial, and historical wildfire data. The goal is to enhance predictive accuracy by accounting for geographic variability in wildfire behavior, enabling more targeted risk assessment and resource planning.
